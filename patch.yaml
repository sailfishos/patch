Description: |
    The patch program applies diff files to originals.  The diff command
    is used to compare an original to a changed file.  Diff lists the
    changes made to the file.  A person who has the original file can then
    use the patch command with the diff file to add the changes to their
    original file (patching the file).
    
    Patch should be installed because it is a common way of upgrading
    applications.
